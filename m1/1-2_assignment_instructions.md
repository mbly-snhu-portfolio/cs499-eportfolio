# CS 499 Module One Assignment Guidelines and Rubric

## Overview

In this assignment, you will begin working toward a successful ePortfolio by creating an initial plan describing how you will meet the course outcomes and requirements in the Final Project Guidelines and Rubric. While the plan you submit in this assignment may not be final, it should be a solid starting point with clear ideas for your instructor to review. You should view this assignment as a way to begin a conversation with your instructor that will result in a challenging but practical plan to follow. By developing a clear plan, you will produce an ePortfolio that showcases your skills across the key fields of computer science.

There is some flexibility in the components you select for the ePortfolio, as noted in the final project guidelines. You will select at least one (maximum of three) artifact to represent your growth in three key areas of computer science: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The artifacts you choose may include work from previous courses in the Computer Science program or relevant work that you created outside of your coursework, such as at a job or internship. If you use artifacts that you created outside of coursework, you will need to request approval from your instructor to use those artifacts. If the artifact is from a job, you will also need permission from your work supervisor to host the artifacts on GitHub. A single artifact may demonstrate your skills in only one area (such as software engineering or databases), two, or all three key categories.

During this course, you will enhance the artifacts you choose to improve their quality, address their limitations or inconsistencies, or mitigate vulnerabilities. Your instructor will help you revise your initial enhancement ideas and plans. These can be completed during the course and will showcase your skills.

For this assignment, you will provide your initial plans for your artifact enhancements. You will also explain how these plans align with the course outcomes and demonstrate your computer science skills. Since the final project accounts for 70% of your grade for this course, connecting your ePortfolio plan to the course outcomes in the final project rubric is important. Use this assignment to plan your outcome coverage and refer to this plan throughout the course to help ensure complete coverage.

## Directions

In your final project, you will enhance artifacts to demonstrate your computer science skills in these key areas:

- Software design and engineering
- Algorithms and data structures
- Databases

**Note:** Artifacts are the products you create from source code.

Use the Module One Assignment template, linked in the What to Submit section below, to present and explain your plan to complete artifact enhancements in the key categories above and fulfill the requirements for the CS 499 ePortfolio.

To set up your ePortfolio plan, you will:

- Select artifacts to demonstrate your skills in the three categories above.
- Note if each artifact comes from a Computer Science course or work outside the program.
- If an artifact is from work outside the program, now is the time to ask for your instructor's approval to use it for this course. You will also need to request permission from your work supervisor to host the artifacts on GitHub.
- Discuss your plans for enhancing or refining your work to improve its quality while further demonstrating your skills in the category.
- Explain how this planned enhancement will illustrate specific skills and identify course outcomes.
- Include a pseudocode or a flowchart that illustrates the planned enhancement. Refer to this pseudocode or graphic in your written description.

### ePortfolio Overall

Consider the following questions:

- If you fulfill your enhancement plans, what specific skills or knowledge will your work demonstrate?
- Are there any gaps relative to the course outcomes?
- Are there remaining limitations or weaknesses you may need to address?
- Are there particular questions or concerns that you would like your instructor to address in their response to this plan?

Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

### Self-Introduction

Address all the following questions to introduce yourself:

- How long have you been in the Computer Science program?
- What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills.
- Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.
- How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans?
- How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?

### ePortfolio Set Up

- Submit a screen capture of your ePortfolio home page that clearly shows your URL.
- Access GitHub Pages, the platform you will use to build your ePortfolio.
- Follow the instructions for setting up an account and profile with GitHub Pages.

### Enhancement Plan

#### Category One: Software Engineering and Design

- Select an artifact that is aligned with the category and explain its origin.
- Describe a practical, well-illustrated plan for enhancement in alignment with the category, including a pseudocode or flowchart that illustrates the planned enhancement.
- Explain how the planned enhancement will demonstrate specific skills and align with course outcomes.

Course outcomes are listed in the assignment template. Refer to the Final Project Guidelines and Rubric for more details on course outcomes.

#### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

- Select an artifact that is aligned with the category and explain its origin.
- Describe a practical, well-illustrated plan for enhancement in alignment with the category, including a pseudocode or flowchart that illustrates the planned enhancement.
- Explain how the planned enhancement will demonstrate specific skills and align with course outcomes.

Course outcomes are listed in the assignment template. Refer to the Final Project Guidelines and Rubric for more details on course outcomes.

#### Category Three: Databases

- Select an artifact that is aligned with the category and explain its origin.
- Describe a practical, well-illustrated plan for enhancement in alignment with the category, including a pseudocode or flowchart that illustrates the planned enhancement.
- Explain how the planned enhancement will demonstrate specific skills and align with course outcomes.

Course outcomes are listed in the assignment template. Refer to the Final Project Guidelines and Rubric for more details on course outcomes.

### ePortfolio Overall Skill Set

- Accurately describe the skill set to be illustrated by the ePortfolio overall.
- Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the code review
- Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the narratives
- Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the professional self-assessment

Optionally, you may include any questions or concerns you would like your instructor to address in responding to your plan at the end of your document.
